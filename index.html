                <h2>Outdoor Fanatic</h2>
                <p>In my spare time I like spending time outside, mountainbiking, hiking, running, just a walk, camping, you name it. 
                        Even my holidays are mostly focused on exploring and doing activities that involve the outdoor.
                        The more I can spend outdoor, the better.

                <h2>Tech Enthusiast</h2>
                <p> Ever since I was a kid, I've been hooked on Tech. 
                    There's always something new to learn, and the stuff I don't get yet just fuels my curiosity. 
                    This results in losing sleep over it from time to time!

                <h2>Modest Homecook</h2>
                <p> As any other person that moved out of their parents home, one of the obstacles is cooking yourself a meal.
                    This obstacle resulted for me in a new hobby, cooking meals which are not only healthy, but also look and taste amazing.

                <p> <b><i>'Have you seen this one already?'</i></b><br>Is a question I will ask more than is good for anyone. 
                    I'm very Enthusiastic about movies and shows and I'm always on the look-out for more to watch!
